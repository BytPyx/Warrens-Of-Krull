        <h1><strong><center>History of Krull</center></strong></h1>

        <hr>
        <p>A mass was all that existed, until the Twin Gods, Eirus and Anodyne came.
            They took, and from it formed Krull. Eirus gave it order, and Anodyne gave it potential.
            A balance between order and chaos was established, and preserved. The younger gods came,
             and built a home among the lands of the Twin Gods domain a world of Tempests and Terran,
             Aqua and Inferno. The world of Krull was born, and the balance preserved... 
        </p>
        <p>
            ... Until one among them decided to create mortality. Sentience and will aside from those
            of the Gods, the balance began to sway. Mortals affected the balance of powers directly with their
            worship of the differing Gods. Soon, among the younger Gods, status was seen by the number of
            followers one could attract. Then status turned to power, and soon holy wars waged across the 
            entire world of Krull. 
        </p>
        <p>Eirus and Anodyne saw that their work was being undone, and just as the world tipped on the edge, 
            they used their power to bring all the Gods together to meet. For years armistice was discussed,
            until it became clear that no agreement would be reached. At this point, a mandate was given by the 
            Twin Gods. All divinity must depart the plane of mortals, and secede to the outer planes of existence. 
            All the Gods were forced to partake in this pact, or face extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the Gods created for themselves Warrens, demi-planes outside the material plane, in which to dwell.
            They moved back to these, wherein they could see the material plane, but not affect it directly. 
            Eiurs and Anodyne were the last to depart, but in leaving satisfied their work was intact, they 
            entered a deep slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mortality never forgot the divinity which made it. It was discovered that though the Gods could not 
            interfere with the material plane directly, through worship, mortality could call upon their powers.
            Some Gods grew in power, others, lacking influence upon Krull, eventually slumbered, as did the Twin 
            Gods. But mortality grew.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Drakkin took to the deep. They bathed in the infernal pits, the heat soothing their scaly hides.
             The Dwarves mined just below the surface, finding precious metals to heap upon altars to their Gods. 
             The Elves took to the forest, cultivating the land, tending to the balance of chaotic potential and 
             ordered prosperity.
             The Humans spread to every corner of Krull. They built civilizations and thrived, cities of order.
        </p>
        <p>
            One civilization in particular overtook the continent. Their order and regiment soon conquered all,
            and in time, became known simply as "The Imperium." Their capitol city, Trantor, was founded at the
            meeting place of the Gods, where a font of magic now permeates the ground. Magical marvels fuel the 
            Imperium, instantaneous travel allows their highly trained legions to keep the peace. Their gold and 
            glory have brought relative peace to Krull. Wars still wage among differing religious factions, but 
            are kept within bounds by the iron first of The Imperium, ruled by the great Emperor Viribus.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, something changed. A strange fog rolled off the southern coast of Trantor, and soon overcame 
            the city. All those it enveloped slowly lost their minds. Subtly at first, and then with speed, the 
            city descended into Chaos. Those that could flee did, but the Imperial Legions were ordered first to 
            purge the city, and then fought each other in the streets. Wealth untold was left lying in the streets
            of the Imperial Capitol, to be scavenged by any who dared brave the ruins. And yet, none so brave have 
            returned...
        </p>
        <p>
            ... Twelve years passed. The strength of the Imperium kept tyrannical order upon the continent, and with 
            their protection out of the way, humanity soon began to wonder why they should pay exorbitant taxes, and 
            began to chafe at their rule. Soon, a civil war started in the east. Factions broke off, desiring 
            to form a Republic, then states all began to secede. The Dwarves to the west violently overthrew their 
            overlords, the Drakkin began to scavenge and raid Imperial borders, and the Elves simply withdrew quietly. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            The world has been changing, and the Imperium is now a small sliver of its former glory. Some would like 
            to see it return to its place at the heart of civilization, some would like to see it stamped out forever, 
            and still others just want to pillage the ruins. These all vie for power now in a world where nothing is 
            certain.
